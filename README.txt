the data can be got by the link https://1drv.ms/u/s!Au_cHqZBKiu2gt83vtq388bmzxQYBw?e=uBXo4S.
Due to the data is too large, we only upload the training data and mask for B=30. if you want to test B=10 or 20, just slice data to B=10 or 20.

Usage:
1.Change the corresponding path of mask in the file 'dataLoadess.py' on line 32.
2.Change the corresponding path of training and test data in the file 'train.py' on line 20, 21.
3.Change the compress_rate you want run in the file 'train.py' on line 32. 
4.Run the file 'train.py'
